        <p>"But I must explain to you how all this mistaken idea of denouncing pleasure and praising pain was born
            and I will give you a complete account of the system, and expound the actual teachings of the great
            explorer of the truth, the master-builder of human happiness. No one rejects, dislikes, or avoids
            pleasure itself, because it is pleasure, but because those who do not know how to pursue pleasure
            rationally encounter consequences that are extremely painful. Nor again is there anyone who loves or
            pursues or desires to obtain pain of itself, because it is pain, but because occasionally circumstances
            occur in which toil and pain can procure him some great pleasure. To take a trivial example, which of us
            ever undertakes laborious physical exercise, except to obtain some advantage from it? But who has any
            right to find fault with a man who chooses to enjoy a pleasure that has no annoying consequences, or one
            who avoids a pain that produces no resultant pleasure?"</p>
